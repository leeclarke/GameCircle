NOTES:

canvasUtils: Keep. Add drag/Drop functions here if not in the Main. should be doing drag/drop and verifying that new grid point is valid. Also it could limit move per round in later version.
EntityManager: still needed for managing tiles but not for Player/weapon generation. Just tiles.
GameEngine: Rename to MapBuilderManager and GameCircleManager
SpriteTileManager: could be useful, keep as is.
TiledMap: Thats what we are here for. Refactor if need.
